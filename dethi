Description
You are participating in a toy race featuring toy racing cars, whose racing track is X meters long.

Participants are labeled from 1 to N, and your label is N.

Participant i's toy car's regular speed is V[i] meters per second (m/s), and all toy cars (but yours) always move at the same speed throughout the race.

Your toy car has a special fuel booster (simply, "booster") in it, and it can be configured to move at Z meters per second for the first 1 second of a race (the toy car would then move at V[N] m/s for the remaining distance).

You can set the integer value for Z prior to the race, and this value must be no greater than the maximum speed Y of the booster (that is, Z ≤ Y).

You want to make sure you are the only winner in this race, but you don't want to raise suspicions by using too much of a booster -- hence, you want to find the smallest Z that will let you win the race alone.

For instance, suppose that N = 3, X = 12, Y = 11, and V = [3, 2, 1].

Participant 1's car moves at 3 m/s, and finishes the race in 4 seconds.
Participant 2's car moves at 2 m/s, and finishes the race in 6 seconds.
Participant 3 (you) have a couple of options.
If you don't use the booster at all, your car moves at 1 m/s, and finishes the race in 12 seconds.
If you use the booster at maximum speed (Z = Y), then your car moves 11 m for the first second, and travels the remaining 1 m for 1 second. You'd win the race alone.
If you use the booster a bit less with Z = 10, then your care moves 10 m for the first second, and travels the remaining 2 m for 2 seconds. You'd win the race alone.
If you use the booster a bit less with Z = 9, then you'd finish the race in 4 seconds. There'll be two winners -- participant 1 and participant 3.
In this example you will need Z ≥ 10 in order to win the race alone, so the answer is 10.

Given N, X, Y, and V[i]'s, compute the smallest integer value Z that allows you to win the race alone.

Input
The first line will contain T, the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first line will contain N, X, and Y separated by a whitespace.

The second line will contain N integers separated by a whitespace, representing each car's speed (V[i]).

Output
For each test case, output the smallest Z which is the distance that your car will travel using the booster. 

If you can win the race alone without using the booster, output 0.

If you can't win the race even if you use the booster at maximum capacity, output -1.
